# Tesla Vehicle
Control your Tesla vehicle using Homey. An alternative to the [Tesla Smart Charger](https://homey.app/sv-se/app/com.tesla.charger/Tesla-Smart-Charger/). Another approach. Add buttons to control heating, defrost, trunk, frunk and more.

## Description

To configure the app, you will need a refresh token issued by Tesla. Try a smart phone app like [Auth app for Tesla](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/auth-app-for-tesla/id1552058613) or [Tesla Tokens](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.leveugle.teslatokens&hl=en_US).

This is an early version. It might help to make sure your Tesla(s) are online before installing. For now, a more solid product is the Tesla Smart Charger.

Install the app. Go to app settings and enter the refresh token and you are ready to go.
